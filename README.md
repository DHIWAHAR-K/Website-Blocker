# Website Blocker in Python

## Overview

This Python script creates a simple website blocker using the `hosts` file to restrict access to specified websites during certain hours. The provided script allows users to input a list of websites and set time intervals for blocking access. Explore this script to understand the basics of implementing a website blocker in Python.

## Script Components

- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide a list of websites and set blocking intervals.
- **Blocking Logic:** Modifying the `hosts` file to block specified websites during the defined time intervals.
- **Unblocking Logic:** Restoring the `hosts` file to unblock websites outside the specified time intervals.
- **Output Display:** Displaying messages and notifications to the user.

## Running the Script

1. Open and edit the Python script (`website_blocker.py`) to add the list of websites and set blocking intervals.
2. Run the script with elevated privileges (e.g., as administrator or using `sudo`).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to initiate or terminate website blocking.

## Customization

- Modify the script to include additional features such as password protection or custom messages during blocking.
- Experiment with different time intervals and website lists according to your preferences.
- Adapt the code to run the script automatically on system startup.
